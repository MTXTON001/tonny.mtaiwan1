<h2 align="left"><ins>What is Computer Security?</ins></h2>   
<p align="left"> Computer security, also known as cyber security or IT security, is the protection of computer systems from the theft and damage to their hardware, software or information, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide. Before anyone can make implementation of computer security, they first have to understand whta are the basic components of computer system that have to be protected.</p> 
<p>The following are the components of computer system;</p>    
<h2><li>Hardware</li></h2>.<p>This the physical part of the computer, like the system memory and disk drive.</p>
<h2><li>Firmware</li></h2>.<p>This the permanent software that runs the processes of the computer and is mostly invisible to the user, like the start-up functions that make elements of the hardware work together</p>
<h2><li>Software</li></h2>. <p>This is the programming that offers services to the user and administrator. The operating system, word processor, computer games, and Internet browser are all examples of software commonly found on a computer.</p>
<p>After having understood the above component, one should also have a better understanding of the data she will be protecting which includes its <em><ins>Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability</ins></em></p>

<h2><li>Confidentiality</li></h2> <p>Confidentiality is roughly equivalent to privacy. Measures undertaken to ensure confidentiality are designed to prevent sensitive information from reaching the wrong people, while making sure that the right people can in fact get it.</p>
<h2><li>Integrity</li></h2><p>This involves maintaining the consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of data over its entire life cycle. Data must not be changed in transit, and steps must be taken to ensure that data cannot be altered by unauthorized people (for example, in a breach of confidentiality). These measures include file permissions and user access controls. Version control maybe used to prevent erroneous changes or accidental deletion by authorized users becoming a problem </p>
<h2><li>Availability</li></h2> <p>Availability is best ensured by rigorously maintaining all hardware, performing hardware repairs immediately when needed and maintaining a correctly functioning operating system environment that is free of software conflicts.</p>

<p> How can we define security Attacks?</p>
<h2><li>Threats</li></h2>
<p>This includes things that can potentially harm our assetA threat refers to a new or newly discovered incident with the potential to do harm to a system or your overall organization. There are three main types of threats â€“ natural threats (e.g., floods or a tornado), unintentional threats (such as an employee mistakenly accessing the wrong information) and intentional threats</p>
<h2><li>Vulnerability</li></h2><p>A vulnerability refers to a known weakness of an asset (resource) that can be exploited by one or more attackers. In other words, it is a known issue that allows an attack to be successful. For example, when a team member resigns and you forget to disable their access to external accounts, change logins or remove their names from company credit cards, this leaves your business open to both intentional and unintentional threats. </p>
<p><h2><li>Risk</li></h2>Risk refers to the potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability. Examples of risk include financial losses as a result of business disruption, loss of privacy, reputational damage, legal implications and can even include loss of life.</p>
<p>Risk can also be defined as follows:</p>
<h2 align="center"> <ins>Risk = Threat X Vulnerability</ins></h2>

<p>Below is a report which shows crucial areas where security is mostly important. the leding sector is customer records which is mostly applied to banks and and forensic studies such as FBI and CIA.</p>
